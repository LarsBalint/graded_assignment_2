# graded_assignment_2

Every time you need to make changes to the notebook, 
go to the GA2_notebooks folder, find the latest version, and download it on your computer.
Name the notebook 'GA2-part(x)_version_(y)'
where x is the part of the assignment you worked on and the version is amount of times you have worked on this same part.

Create a Conda Environment using GA2_Geopandas_Spec.txt:
  Open Anaconda
  Go to Environments in the top left
  Then go to Import in the bottom right
  then choose local environment/conda
  then locate the file GA2_Geopandas_Spec.txt
  click import

  Every time you launch Jupyter from Anaconda, make sure you have the correct environment selected.

Please don't change the GA2_template.ipynb

Thank you
