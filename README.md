# graded_assignment_2

Please make all changes to GA2-part1_complete.ipynb.

Create a Conda Environment using GA2_Geopandas_Spec.txt:
  Open Anaconda
  Go to Environments in the top left
  Then go to Import in the bottom right
  then choose local environment/conda
  then locate the file GA2_Geopandas_Spec.txt
  click import

  Everytime you launch Jupyter from Anaconda, make sure have the correct environment selected.

Do not change GA2_template.ipynb

Thank you
